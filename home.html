                <h1>Things I like</h1>
                <h2>Math</h2>
                <p>Something about college calculus has reignited my love for math that I lost a while ago in middle school</p>
                <h2>Roguelikes</h2>
                <p>Something about the endless replayability and difficult makes these games incredibly appealing</p>
                <h2>Rhythm Games</h2>
                <p>I have a natural love for music and rhythm games are a great way to express this</p>

            <div class="likes-box">
                <h1>Languages</h1>
                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p>Python was my first language, and I still use it because of how useful it is.</p>
                <h2>Rust</h2>
                <p>I'm in the process of learning Rust for my school's Solar Car Design Team.</p>
                <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
                <p>I couldn't really make this website without those two.</p>
                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p>In my junior year of high school, I took a class on Java and managed to recreate Minesweeper.</p>
